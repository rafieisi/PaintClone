	Yesterday : Nothing 
	Today     : Sprint planned, Git issues solved.
	Obstacles : Working with Git merge.

	Yesterday : Sprint Planned, Duties were assigned and tried to understand the assignment 
	Today     : Worked on Bug no 5 which is solving Squiggles. Now, each drag of the mouse is a separate squiggle.
	            Basically, the issue of the representation of the squiggles is fixed.		  
	Obstacles : understanding MouseEvents such as MouseExited and creating references

	Today     : Now, I can add rectangle to the canvas with the real time update, basically when 
	            the user is drawing it, the user can see where it has been drawn. 
	Obstacles : The problem is that when rectangle is been drawn it, starts from origin always.
	            Instead, of one corner of a rectangle being drag, and release to 
		        specify two corners of a rectangle to be drawn in the current style.

	Today     : Implementing so the rectangle is been drawn correctly which start from mouse click and where 
				the click is released. Begin implementing the Square class which extends from rectangle class.
	Obstacles :

	Yesterday : Implementing so the rectangle is been drawn correctly which start from mouse click and where 
		        the click is released. Begin implementing the Square class which extends from shape class
	Today     : Worked on Square class and fixed so it is drawn in all 4 directions and in a perfect way. 
	Obstacles : The square has all 4 sides equally in magnitude, if the square is flip over to other direction, it was moving up or 
				down so it was fixed using 2 cases. If yintial is less than yfinal then y becomes yintial. If yfinal is less than 
                yintial then we do Math.min(y0, y0 - Math.abs(xf-x0)) since yfinal point has been dislocated to get it we 
                subtract the delta x from yintial.
