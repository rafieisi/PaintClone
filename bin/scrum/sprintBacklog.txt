TYPE     : BUG 1
NAME     : Icons instead of text for drawing mode selection
OWNER    : 
PRIORITY : 11
ESTIMATE : 1 hour.
ISSUE    : Would be nice to have icons instead of "Circle", "Rectangle", ...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 2
NAME     : Drawing selection mode not indicated
OWNER    : 
PRIORITY : 12
ESTIMATE : 2 hours
ISSUE    : Currently ,you can't tell which mode "Circle", "Rectangle", ...
           is currently selected. Is JButton correct, is there a way
           to highlight the currently selected mode?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 3
NAME     : Architecture behind choosing selection mode is poor
OWNER    : 
PRIORITY : 2
ESTIMATE : 3 hours
ISSUE    : Code is not modular and is difficult to expand. Need a better
           architecture behind selecting a drawing mode, and handling
           the drawing events. Consider some design patterns here.
           Refactor ShapeChooserPanel and PaintPanel to get rid of the
           'if' blocks in the PaintPanel mouse event code.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 4
NAME     : Architecture behind Model is poor
OWNER    : 
PRIORITY : 1
ESTIMATE : 3 hours
ISSUE    : Having a list of different types of drawable things in the
           model is cumbersome. In fact, it is currently incorrect, with
           Squiggle's not drawing properly. Need to re-architect the Model
           so that it is more flexible, and easier to work with.
           Consider some design patterns, or change of responsibility
           here.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 5
NAME     : Squiggle is broken
OWNER    : 
PRIORITY : 3
ESTIMATE : 2 hour
ISSUE    : Squiggles are connected to each other by a straight line. Each drag
		   of the mouse should be a separate squiggle. Possibly
           the issue is with the representation of the squiggles in the Model.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 6
NAME     : Circle drawing is broken
OWNER    : 
PRIORITY : 4
ESTIMATE : 1 hour
ISSUE    : The first click should specify the center of the circle, with
           a drag for the radius. This is not the case in the current
           implementation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : BUG 7
NAME     : Shapes should draw themselves to avoid if statements in PaintPanel

ESTIMATE : 2 hours (over estimate)
AS A     : user
I WANT   : As a user is specifying a Circle, during the drag, a 'current'

           circle changes in real time so that a circle is drawn with
           centre at users initial circle click, with radius out to
           the current dragged mouse position.
SO THAT  : I can see the circle I am about to build on release of the mouse
           button.
